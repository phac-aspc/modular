<h2>Vaccines administered</h2>

<h3 id="a1">Data sources</h3>
<!--<p>Information on doses distributed is obtained weekly from the Government of Canada’s National Operations Centre.</p>-->
<p>Information on COVID-19 vaccine doses administered are obtained from provincial and territorial partners or their websites. Although we update this information every day, each province and territory updates according to their own schedule:
    <ul>
        <li>Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick update daily</li>
        <li>British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Yukon update every weekday</li>
        <li>Northwest Territories updates every Monday</li>
        <li>Nunavut updates every Tuesday</li>
        <li>Prince Edward Island updates every Tuesday and Thursday</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3 id="a2">Definitions</h3>

<p><strong>Vaccine doses administered</strong>: The number of COVID-19 vaccine doses that a jurisdiction has given to people.</p>
<p><strong>Cumulative number</strong>: The total number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered between December 13, 2020 and the report date.</p>
<!--<p><strong>Daily number</strong>: The number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered on a given day. This is the difference in the reported number of vaccine doses administered between one day and the day before.</p>-->

<h3 id="a3">Data caveats and limitations</h3>

<h4>Differences between federal and provincial or territorial numbers</h4>
<p>There may be differences in the number of vaccine doses we report as administered and the number that provinces and territories report on their websites. This occurs when provinces and territories update their websites after we have already updated our website.</p>

<h4>Vaccines doses administered</h4>
<p>The number of vaccine doses administered may be higher than those reported. This is due to delays in reporting.</p>
<p>The number of vaccine doses administered is not the same as the number of people vaccinated. This is because some vaccines (such as the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca and COVIDSHIELD COVID-19 vaccines) require that people receive two doses. Thus, this information should not be used as a substitute for vaccination coverage estimates.</p>


<h2>Vaccination coverage</h2>
    
<h3 id="a4">Data sources</h3>

<h4>Numerator data</h4>
<p>Each week, provincial and territorial partners share data with us about the number of people who were vaccinated against COVID-19. This data includes age, sex, vaccine used, and the number of doses.</p>

<h4>Denominator data</h4>
<p>Denominator data were provided by Statistics Canada and include population size estimates by age, sex, and province or territory as of July 1, 2020. Estimates were derived from 2016 Census of Population counts adjusted for Census net undercoverage and growth using several different administrative files.</p>

<h3 id="a5">Definitions</h3>

<h4>Vaccination status</h4>
<p>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
        <li><strong>At least one dose</strong>: People who have received a COVID-19 vaccine, regardless of the number of doses. People in this category may have received either one or two doses, and so are either partially or fully vaccinated.</li>
        <li><strong>Partially vaccinated</strong>: People who have received only one dose of a vaccine that requires two doses to complete the vaccination series (such as the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, or COVISHIELD COVID-19 vaccines).</li>
        <li><strong>Fully vaccinated</strong>: People who have either: 
            <ul>
                <li>Received both doses of a vaccine that requires two doses to complete the vaccination series (such as the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, or COVISHIELD COVID-19 vaccines).</li>
                <li>Received one dose of a vaccine that only requires one dose  to complete the vaccination series (such as the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine).</li>
                <li>Received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine after a previous laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection (only in Quebec).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>Reporting values</h4>
<p>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
        <li><strong>Report week</strong>: The week that the data was reported up to. For example, the report dated <span class="currentWeekTech">January 2, 2021</span> includes data from when COVID-19 vaccination began in Canada (the week of December 13, 2020) up to and including <span class="currentWeekTech">January 2, 2021</span>.</li>
        <li><strong>Cumulative number</strong>: The total number of people given a COVID-19 vaccine, beginning from when vaccination began in Canada (the week of December 13, 2020) up to the report week.</li>
        <li><strong>Cumulative percent</strong>: The percent of the population that has been given a COVID-19 vaccine. This is calculated by dividing the “Cumulative number” by the estimated population size and multiplying by 100.</li>
        <!--<li><strong>Weekly number</strong>: The difference between this week’s and last week’s report in the cumulative number of people given a COVID-19 vaccine.</li>-->
        <!--<li><strong>Weekly percent</strong>: The difference between this week’s and last week’s report in the cumulative percent of people given a COVID-19 vaccine.</li>-->
        <li><strong>Not reported</strong>: Data is labeled as “not reported” when a jurisdiction provides data that has not been broken down into relevant categories.</li>
        <li><strong>Unknown</strong>: Data is labeled as “unknown” when a jurisdiction does not know the value of a particular variable for one or more vaccine recipients. For example, if the age group of a vaccine recipient is unknown, they would report that recipient’s age group as unknown.</li>
        <li><strong>n/a</strong>: “n/a” stands for “not applicable” or “not available”. It is used in the figure text descriptions when a value does not exist or the information is not available. Generally, it is used in place of the cumulative percent when a variable value (for example, the age group of the vaccine recipient) is unknown and there is no appropriate denominator. It is also used to indicate that the information is not available because it was not reported by a particular jurisdiction.</li>
        <!--<li><strong>Percent since last report</strong>: Indicates the increase in the percent of the population vaccinated since the last weekly report. This is calculated by subtracting the “Total number” in last week’s report from that of this week’s report. The difference is then dived by the estimated population size and multiplied by 100. Note that delays in reporting can result in an artificial decrease or increase in vaccination coverage counts from the week before.</li>-->
    </ul>
</p>

<h3 id="a6">Data caveats and limitations</h3>

<h4>Reporting delays</h4>
<p>Reporting delays may result in an artificial decrease or increase in the number of people vaccinated since the previous report.</p>

<h4>Data availability</h4>
<p>The following table provides a summary of what data was not available for each jurisdiction by week.</p>
<details id="det" onclick="Open_Close()">
    <summary>Data availability</summary>  
    <div class="table-responsive">
        <table id="datavail-table" class="table table-bordered table-striped table-hover">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th style="column-width: 350px;">Week ending</th>
                    <th>Data availability issues</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody></tbody>
        </table>
    </div>
</details>

<h4>Differences between federal and provincial or territorial numbers</h4>
<p>Vaccination coverage estimates released by provinces and territories may differ from those provided in this report due to:
    <ul>
        <li>the availability of updated data</li>
        <li>differences in reporting periods</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Occasionally, provinces and territories may report on individuals who were vaccinated in their jurisdiction but who live in another jurisdiction. This can result in an overestimation of vaccination coverage estimates in the vaccinating province or territory and an underestimation of coverage in the province or territory of residence.</p>

<h4>Data suppression</h4>
<p>Data are suppressed in this report if a province or territory has concerns around releasing values less than five for their jurisdiction. Provinces and territories that suppress values less than five include Saskatchewan, Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut.</p>
<p>If a province or territory has a category with a value of less than five, that value is removed from national totals to prevent the value from being calculated.</p>

<h4>Denominator data</h4>
<p>Population size estimates were calculated using the most recent and reliable information available at Statistics Canada. As approximations and rounding were applied to the data when defining these groups, these numbers are estimates.  The true size of these populations may be larger or smaller, which could affect coverage estimates.</p>
