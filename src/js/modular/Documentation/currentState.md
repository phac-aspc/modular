Current state of modular code. Which version you should you use and cases for each.

Bar graphs
 - Updating is the best one. Would always use it
     - Uses vertically flat data formats, has more of the new stuff added to it (uncertainty lines, performance updates, etc)
 - Non-updating: Horizontally flat data format. Otherwise don't use it. Will not be touching, basically v1

Line graphs
 - Use the non-updating one.
    - Has the most recent updates (very intuitive) 
 - Updating has the nested c-series, but is otherwise incomplete in functionality. Started it for CARRS. Only use for static line graphs with nested c-series
